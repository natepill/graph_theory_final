Airline Graph Project Proposal
Cheapest path from City A to City B
The most popular airport
Cheapest path with stops, ie City A, City B, City C


Problem: Given an airplane routing network, find the cheapest path from one city to another, find if there is there a route back to a given city, and find the cheapest route with between two cities with a single stop.

Model the problem: A network of airplane routes is represented by a graph with each vertex being a city and the weighted edges being the distance to travel between cities.
